**ScientificCalculator**
A versatile scientific calculator built with Java using the Swing framework, offering a wide array of mathematical functionalities with a modern, intuitive interface. Inspired by the sleek design of the Apple iOS Calculator, this project combines robust computation with a customizable dark theme, making it both functional and visually appealing.

**Features**
. Core Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
. Advanced Functions: Includes trigonometric (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic (log, ln), exponential (e^x, 10^x), square root, cube, absolute value, and more.
. Special Calculations: Supports modulus, factorial, power, and memory operations (MC, MR, M+, M-).
. Keyboard Integration: Fully keyboard-accessible with support for digits, operators (+, -, *, /, ^, !), decimal points, backspace, escape (clear), and both '=' and Enter keys for evaluation.
. Responsive Layout: Dynamically scales buttons and display for minimized, intermediate, and maximized window sizes.
. Customizable Theme: Features a dark theme mimicking the Apple iOS Calculator, with a dark gray background, white text, and rounded buttons with a pressed effect. Switch to light mode via the menu.
. Error Management: Handles invalid inputs and division by zero gracefully.
